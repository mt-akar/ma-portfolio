## 6) MAOS - Operating System (How I Work)

**Goal:** Share principles and rhythms, not tools for their own sake.

**Structure:** Two‑column playbook: **Cadence & Communication** / **Thinking & Records**.

**Content:**

- **Async by default; transparent by design.** I favor written decisions and make space for deep work.
- **Open door.** No one should feel daunted to reach out—clarity beats ceremony.
- **Notes → Processes → Policy.** I route ideas through a simple pipeline so good patterns stick.
- **Systems over heroics.** I design for rollback, audit, and graceful failure.
