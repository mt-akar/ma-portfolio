## 8) Toolbox (Stack & Setup)

**Goal:** Practical credibility via a dense, scrollable icon pool.

**Structure:** The technologies are represented by their icon and their name below the icon that forms a tool view. Each group of tool views rotate around a circle to form a saturn’s rings pattern. And each planet circles an imaginary sun (nothing there) on a slightly offset plane. The planets must come into view from the upper left side of the screen, circle around in their orbit towards the right and down. The planet’s are opaque so the technologies behind the planet are not visible. The planets are aligned in equal lengths to each other around their orbit and they come in and out of the view periodically. Take a shot at creating this animation using CSS (tailwind, JS is necessary). 

Make it both group count and tool count in one group completely extendible, I will be adding many more to these.
