The Journey
The Vision
While building Coin Checkout—a crypto payments infrastructure, I recognized an opportunity to revolutionize charitable giving.

The thought of enabling the difference makers of the world to collect donations so much more easier was too exciting to pass up.

I wanted the platform to be completely transparent, full self-custody, zero fee, and super easy to use.

The Team
Rallied the Coin Checkout team around a shared vision of using tech for social good.

I was happy to see them jump at the opportunity to volunteer their expertise and time.

Cointribute was born.

The Reach
We proactively reach out to charities, spend time explaining the benefits, and set it up for them.

From local community organizations to international NGOs, we're breaking down barriers to crypto adoption in the nonprofit sector.

I know that I am not the captain of this ship, but only the servant of the cause. Everything I do is only meaningful with the team and hardworking volunteers of charities, they are the real heroes.

Human Impact
The platform processes millions of crypto tokens every day.

Enabled disaster relief efforts to receive instant global support, education initiatives to fund scholarships, and medical charities to purchase life-saving equipment.

Every successful donation reminds me why we build—real lives, real impact.

My Commitment
I donate what I value most—my time and expertise—to keep this platform running for free forever.

Success isn't just profit, but the cumulative value we create.

This beautiful intersection of technology and humanity defines my approach to life.
